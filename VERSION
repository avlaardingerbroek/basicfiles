Optional. --gnits required:
one line containing many fields separated with a single space. From left to right, these fields are:
The program name, at least when it is different from the package name, or when specific program version numbers follow. 
Whea single package distributes many programs, the program name is always given.
The program version numbers, but only if they differ from the version numbers of the whole package. This happens, rather 
unfrequently, when a single package distributes programs which are maintained by different people, each using his own
version scheme (e.g. the Texinfo distribution).
A single dash `-' character, surrounded by one space on each side, of course. This string is used in case both the p
rogram name and the package name are given. When only the package and package version numbers are given, it is assumed that
the program name is identical to the package name, and that program version numbers are the same as the package
version n
umbers. In this case, this single dash is omitted.
The optional word `GNU', all in capitals.
The mandatory package name.
The mandatory version numbers for the package name.
